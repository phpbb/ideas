# phpBB Ideas

phpBB Ideas is an ideas centre for phpBB. It is based on [WordPress ideas](http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/), and allows users to suggest and vote on "ideas" that would help improve and enhance phpBB.

## Installation

To install, copy `config.sample.php` to `config.php` and change the configuration. The current configuration settings:

- **PHPBB_ROOT_PATH** - The path to phpBB. Eg, if you put `ideas/` in the phpBB directory itself, this should be set to `../`
- **IDEAS_FORUM_ID** - The ID of the forum that ideas topics will be posted to.
- **IDEA_POSTER_ID** - The ID of the user that will post idea topics into the forums.

Then run `install.php` (make sure that you have UMIL in your root phpBB directory), which will set up the database.

Finally, add two BBCodes, similar to these:

```
[idea={NUMBER}]{TEXT}[/idea]
<a href="/ideas/idea.php?id={NUMBER}">{TEXT}</a>

[user={NUMBER}]{TEXT}[/user]
<a href="/phpBB/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u={NUMBER}">{TEXT}</a>
```

Those BBCodes are used in the forum topics created by phpBB Ideas to link back to the ideas. Make sure you change the URLs so that they are correct.
